# The-damn-cornbread
The usual, the dog needed a walk, we took her out to the old rail track,a nice, level, easy walk. We were met by the Saturday morning run community. Myriads of people doing the Saturday Cancer Run were coming towards us, the dog of course had to get in the way, creating an obstacle for the runners and forcing them to make a split decision, stop, swerve or even jump over. 
Most of them, thankfully, swerved, I don't know whether the dog would stay put if they decided to jump over it. She proceeded to make things even worse by picking up a stick almost a metre in length and running towards the rest of the oncoming runners.
Why was she off her lead might you ask? 
Well, she wanted to be free, plus she pulls on it, creating an image of a rather large brown-black frog, legs splayed out to the sides, scrabbling to push her body forward, chest low to the ground, body leaning as far forward as possible, choking herself in order to simply get ahead. 
We decided it was time to let her off the lead and she just terrorised every single runner instead.  

Grandmama had had enough after 20 minutes, we walked back to the car and we were on our way to Tesco’s to get some of that famous (according to Grandma) cornbread. About a month ago on one of my visits she told me on more than one occasion that the shop had stopped producing it, that it was "a crying shame" because it was the best bread she'd ever had, in fact, on a trip to the store she cornered the baker,asking her why it wasn't available any more. The poor shop assistant explained that products sometimes get taken away and it's due to seasonal items coming in and taking their place. That of course did not sit well. The woman got a lecture on how the bread sold very well and that something else should've been taken away instead. My goodness, I remember I had to drag her away, telling her that the dog had been in the car, on her own for too long and that we still had plenty of shopping to do. If that wasn't enough, on the way to the train station where she was dropping me off, we stopped at a mini Tesco and she had to have it out with a shop assistant in there about the bread too, despite the fact there was no operating bakery in the little store. 
When we got back into the car I strongly advised her to just email the company about it, and expressively told her it would be better than brutally arguing with the poor shop assistants.

Back to today, we bought the cornbread, after she explained to the shop assistant behind the bakery that it was good to have it back, that it should never have been taken away in the first place. She even told them she emailed the company about it after my suggestion of direct contact.
“Grandma you know it's not his fault that they took it away right? Sometimes the company discontinues the lines and you can't order it in.” 
The poor man seemed relieved that I was talking. 
“It doesn't matter at least you can feed it back to your manager when you get a chance.” She said to the man. 

Perhaps just a simple exclamation about the cornbread being the best bread she's ever had would've sufficed.
